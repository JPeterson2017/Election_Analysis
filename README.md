1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received, as well as the percentage of total votes.
4. Calculate the total number of votes that were cast in each county, as well as the percentage of total votes.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Determine which county had the highest number of votes cast.

## Election Audit Summary

In the future, this code can be used and modified to provide a variety of insight. With the current layout, it would be easy to adjust specific fields to gather insight on which candidate had the highest number of votes, by county. You could also leverage the code to analyse which county the majority of each candidates votes came from. The variables themselves are completely based on the data being referrenced, therefore it is dynamic and automatically adjusts, based on the input.
